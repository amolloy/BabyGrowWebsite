<p>The HTML is correctly coded and passed inspection at W3C Markup Validation Service - calls all javascript files and css files in each file where necessary.

<br>

All div's have been labeled to make alterations as easy as possible within the html and CSS files.</p>

<img src="assets/images/htmlstructure.png" alt="HTML Structure" width="783" height="460" />

<p>If you would like to edit the color, font, or style of any elements, you would edit the corresponding CSS style in the CSS file in the CSS folder:</p>

<pre> p {

	font-size:12px;
	color:#fae9e3;
	line-height:1.4em;
    }

<h3 id="cssFiles"><strong>B) CSS Files and Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

<p>Included in this template download is a single CSS directory / folder for the template - all necessary css files are included and shouldn't need any alterations unless you wish to customize anything.</p> 

  <ol>
        <li>main.css - used to style the template page for all browsers</li>
        <li>Chunkfive-webfont.eot, Chunkfive-webfont.svg, Chunkfive-webfont.ttf, Chunkfive-webfont.woff - used for all the headings on the page</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The css file should be easy to follow and if using a modern html page editor you should be able to easily see the structure of each css file.</p>

<h3 id="javascript"><strong>C) JavaScript</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
    
<p>Included in this template download is a single JS directory / folder - all necessary JS file are included and shouldn't need any alterations unless you wish to customize anything. Here is a list and description for each one:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>custom.js - powers the contact form validation and calls the script for media queries for IE9.</li>
    </ol>

<p>Please note that alterations to JS files could result in certain features not working - you should not attempt to alter javascript unless you are experienced - please use the web site references next to each JS file listed above for further details and help.</p>

<hr>
    
<h3 id="psdFiles"><strong>D) PSD Files</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

<p>I've included the psd's (photoshop native files) with this theme:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>idex.psd - fully layered photoshop file  of the  page design</li>
        <li>index_768.psd - fully layered photoshop file of the page design in 768px</li>
        <li>quick edit directory - contains all the editable psd images used within the page</li>
    </ol>

<p>The  PSD files can be opened in Photoshop CS5 or earlier and contain well labelled layers and groups.<br>
All layers are grouped so that elements from sections are contained in a group labelled for ease of finding something very quickly.<br>All layer effects (styles) are included on the layers so that full editing and personalization is fully available.<br>
</p>

<h3 id="credits"><strong>E) Sources, Credits and Fonts - </strong><a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

<p>I've used the following graphical items / fonts that are free to use by their kind authors.

  <ul>
        <li>ChunkFive Font - <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/ChunkFive">http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/ChunkFive</a></li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="php"><strong>F)Contact Form Setup - </strong><a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

<p>Included in the files is the PHP contact is a form mailer script - mailer.php - this file will need to be altered to have a fully functional contact form on your website. This contact form uses AJAX so there is no need for an error or thank you page - the results appear on the page dynamically - a missing field or incorrect formatted email address will result in no submission and dynamic field message - a successful form will result in the form disappearing and a Thank you message being displayed - Please see the section below named contact page for customization details. </p>
<p>It is very important that you alter the &quot;To&quot; field in this script to ensure the results are sent directly to your email of choice - luckily it's silly simple! Just open the mailer script and towards the top you will see the following:</p>
    
<p>mailer.php script editing</p>
    
<p><img src="assets/images/contact.png" alt="email address change" width="508" height="292" /></p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: this script depends on the capabilities of your server setup - they use php5 and expect mail () function to be setup correctly - if you have issues, I can't help as it will be something to contact your hosting company about - some hosts do things a little weird and insist on you using their scripts, some say they have php setup correctly, when indeed they do not.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/contact_message2.png" alt="success message" width="589" height="653" /></p>

<p>In the above screenshot you will see the "Thanks! Please check your email to confirm your subscription." text - this is our generic example text you can alter to your own - obviously this script does NOT send an email to the person subscribing to confirm, it just goes to you (if you altered the email address in the pHP as above) - normally you would plug the results in to a subscription service who would fire-off a follow up email for subscription confirmation - that bit is up to you to organize.</p>
