quote: My two-year old has cystic fibrosis. Due the strong correlation between BMI and lung function in CF, it's extremely important for us to keep a close eye on his weight for length percentile. This is the only app I found that did the wieight for length percentile for kids under two &hellip; I use this app CONSTANTLY, not only to see where he's at currently with his growth, but I also enter information for the next month and see what our goal needs to be for his weight to keep him where we want him!! Thanks!!
